# Descope Cognito User Migration Tool

This repository includes a Python utility for migrating your Cognito users to Descope.

> **Note**: Cognito does not support the export of hashed passwords, therefore you'll need to create temporary passwords for these users and they will have to be reset by each individual user when they sign in with Descope for the first time.

## Setup üíø

1. Clone the Repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/descope/descope-cognito-migration.git
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the Necessary Python libraries

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Setup Your Environment Variables

You can change the name of the `.env.example` file to `.env` to use as a template.

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<Your AWS Access Key>"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<Your AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY>"
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID="<YOUR USER POOL ID>"
DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID="<Your Descope Project ID>"
DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY="Your Descope Management Key>"
```

a. **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**: Obtain your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key by following the steps outlined on the [AWS Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/) and update your `.env` file.

Both can be found after an Access Key is created:

> **Note:** The Secret Access Key itself will be permanently hidden once first generated.

b. **Cognito User Pool ID**: This can be found in the AWS Cognito console.

c. **Descope Project ID and Management Key**: Obtain these from your Descope account under [Project Settings](https://app.descope.com/settings/project) and [Management Keys](https://app.descope.com/settings/company/managementkeys).

## Running the Migration Script üöÄ

To migrate your Cognito users, execute the script with the path to the password hash export file:

```
python3 src/main.py
```

The output will include the responses of the created users within Descope:

```
User successfully created
{"user":{"loginIds":["app@example.com"], "userId":"U2UTvKxVuf4xYe68xYBK2FtFEuTK", "name":"app@example.com", "email":"app@example.com", "phone":"", "verifiedEmail":false, "verifiedPhone":false, "roleNames":[], "userTenants":[], "status":"invited", "externalIds":["app@example.com"], "picture":"", "test":false, "customAttributes":{"CognitoUserId":"64de73a2b160e31c8c3579b7"}, "createdTime":1692976324, "TOTP":false, "SAML":false, "OAuth":{}}}
...
```

## Testing üß™

Unit testing can be performed by running the following command:

```
python3 -m unittest tests.test_migration
```
